## Hey 👋🏻 What's up? 👨🏻‍💻
Hi, I'm Dejv 👨🏻‍💻<br>

I am a 22-year-old front-end developer from Pardubice region. I enjoy improving <br> 
my coding skills and building web applications. 🙋🏻‍♂️

I focus on HTML, CSS, JavaScript and the modern React library, which I consider as my main <br>
tool for front-end development. I also have experience with WordPress. 📚

Front-end / JavaScript / React / Wordpress 🚀

Most of the time you can find me coding or at the gym. My best way to relax? Traveling. 🌏 <br>
I'm a fan of cars, motorbikes, a good cup of coffee and of course coding.

Right now, I'm mainly deepening my knowledge of React. 🌱
